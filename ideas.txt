for Graphical:
Make limbs as couloured varying with optimal angle
how accurate is the position

pass image obj to funciton

result.poselandmarks -> Coordinates of joints
The idea is to start at red: (1.0,0.0,0.0).
Then increase the green to get yellow: (1.0,1.0,0.0).
Then decrease the red to get green: (0.0,1.0,0.0).

image = cv2.line(image,
	tuple(np.multiply(pointB, [640, 480]).astype(int)),
	tuple(np.multiply(pointE, [640, 480]).astype(int)),
	color, 9)
